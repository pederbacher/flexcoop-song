# Flexcoop Flexcoop

## Chorus

Flexcoop, Flexcoop, guarantee my warm shower
the I will always, give you my power 
Flexcoop, together, we will be greener
  .. cleaner


## Verse

When we go hand in hand
We will be a great new band
We share our energy,

If you are not smart and clever
You try to turn me down forever
but when I am empty comes the rebound
... sound, round, town
